# Technical Decisions Log

This document tracks significant technical decisions made during the project's development, including alternatives considered and rationale for the chosen solution.

## Database Management

### Decision: Use an ORM instead of raw SQL
- **Context**: Need to manage database operations in a type-safe and maintainable way
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Raw SQL
     - Pros: Full control, no abstractions, maximum performance
     - Cons: No type safety, manual query building, more error-prone
  2. ORM
     - Pros: Type safety, automatic migrations, better developer experience
     - Cons: Additional abstraction layer, potential performance overhead

- **Decision**: Use an ORM for better type safety and developer experience
- **Consequences**: 
  - Positive: Faster development, fewer runtime errors
  - Negative: Small performance overhead, need to learn ORM-specific patterns

### Decision: Switch from Drizzle to Prisma
- **Context**: Initial implementation used Drizzle but encountered issues with JSON field support
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Drizzle ORM
     - Pros: Lightweight, good performance, SQL-like query builder
     - Cons: Less mature, limited JSON support in SQLite
  2. Prisma
     - Pros: More mature, better documentation, strong TypeScript support
     - Cons: Heavier, requires separate schema file
  3. TypeORM
     - Pros: Well-established, good documentation
     - Cons: More complex, primarily focused on class-based entities

- **Decision**: Use Prisma
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Better developer experience, strong type safety, automatic migrations
  - Negative: JSON stored as string in SQLite (Prisma limitation)

## Database Choice

### Decision: Use SQLite
- **Context**: Need a simple, file-based database for MVP
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. PostgreSQL
     - Pros: More powerful, better JSON support, scalable
     - Cons: Requires separate server, more complex setup
  2. SQLite
     - Pros: File-based, simple setup, good for prototypes
     - Cons: Limited concurrent access, basic feature set
  3. MongoDB
     - Pros: Great JSON support, flexible schema
     - Cons: Separate server, potential over-engineering for MVP

- **Decision**: Use SQLite for simplicity and ease of setup
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Zero-config setup, easy deployment
  - Negative: May need migration to PostgreSQL if scaling becomes necessary

## UI Component Library

### Decision: Use shadcn/ui
- **Context**: Need a flexible, customizable UI component library
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Material UI
     - Pros: Comprehensive, well-documented
     - Cons: Opinionated design, harder to customize
  2. Chakra UI
     - Pros: Good DX, accessible by default
     - Cons: Bundle size, less customizable
  3. shadcn/ui
     - Pros: Copy-paste components, full control, uses Radix UI
     - Cons: Not a traditional library, requires more setup per component

- **Decision**: Use shadcn/ui for maximum flexibility and control
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Full control over components, smaller bundle size
  - Negative: Need to manually add each component

## Framework Choice

### Decision: Use Next.js with App Router
- **Context**: Need a React framework with good developer experience and deployment options
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Create React App
     - Pros: Simple, well-known
     - Cons: Limited features, no SSR
  2. Remix
     - Pros: Great DX, good performance
     - Cons: Steeper learning curve
  3. Next.js
     - Pros: Industry standard, great features, good documentation
     - Cons: App Router is relatively new

- **Decision**: Use Next.js with App Router
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Future-proof, good performance, great DX
  - Negative: Need to keep up with App Router best practices 

## Test Data Strategy

### Decision: Use Prisma Seed Script for Test Data
- **Context**: Need consistent test data for development and testing
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Manual Database Inserts
     - Pros: Simple, direct control
     - Cons: Not reproducible, time-consuming
  2. SQL Seed File
     - Pros: Version controlled, reproducible
     - Cons: No type safety, harder to maintain
  3. Prisma Seed Script
     - Pros: Type-safe, maintainable, integrated with Prisma
     - Cons: Requires additional setup

- **Decision**: Use Prisma seed script with TypeScript
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Type-safe test data, easily reproducible environment
  - Positive: Test data structure matches production format
  - Positive: Can be extended for testing edge cases
  - Negative: Additional dependency (ts-node) needed
