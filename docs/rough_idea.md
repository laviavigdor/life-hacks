Ever-Adapting Smart Diary with Visual Memory Layer
📌 Overview
This app is a mobile-first, chat-based personal companion that functions as an intelligent, evolving diary + planner + tracker. Users input natural language messages—anything from emotions, workouts, trip plans, or journal thoughts—and the app remembers, structures, and visualizes insights on demand through an adaptive interface.

💡 Core Concept
At its heart, the app is a context-aware diary that combines:

Unstructured journaling (your raw thoughts, emotions, routines)

Structured memory extraction (sleep, mood, weight, tasks, etc.)

Adaptive interface that changes based on the activity domain (e.g., trip planning, health tracking, workout logging)

It behaves like a living personal dashboard that grows smarter with every interaction.

🧱 Key Features
1. Conversational Logging (Chat UI)
Mobile chat-like interface for daily logging

Accepts free-form text and voice input

Friendly bot replies, acknowledging and extracting meaning

Feels like talking to a personal assistant

2. Memory Layer
Stores both raw diary entries and structured data:

Mood, sleep, habits, tasks, goals, people, location, health metrics, etc.

Indexed for smart querying

Evolves over time to understand your personal vocabulary (“felt meh” = low mood)

3. On-Demand Visualization
Users can ask:

“Show my mood trend this month”

“What’s my Wednesday workout routine?”

“Visualize my trip plan to Italy”

“Compare sleep and energy levels last week”

Supported visual types:

Line graphs, calendars, timelines, checklists, workout cards, trip maps

4. Adaptive UI Blocks (Widgets)
Interface updates itself to support:

Trip Planning (map, checklist, itinerary block)

Fitness (routines, weight per arm/leg, progress chart)

Shopping List (auto-extracted from entries)

Mood/Wellness Tracking (heatmaps, summaries)

Habit Streaks (habit cards)

Displayed in modular cards below the chat when relevant.

⚙️ Technical Architecture (MVP)
Frontend: React Native (mobile-first), modular components

NLP/LLM: OpenAI GPT-4 for extraction & natural language interface

Database: SQLite (local), structured with diary entries + extracted metadata

Charts: Chart.js or Recharts

State Mgmt: Context API or Zustand

Storage: JSON schema per entry:
